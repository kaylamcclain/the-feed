    <p style="color: antiquewhite;">in this glance back selfie, i am at a cafe called "the mill" that is located in divisadero. i felt particularly productive during this time since i was out in public doing my homework; being around others made me feel more focused and motivated to complete all my work while i was there. as for what i was using the internet for, i was utilizing it to research information on a CEL assignment for my jewish & ethics class. i found that the use of AI and general Google were very helpful and i was grateful for the ability to find lots of accurate information in a short period of time. </p>
