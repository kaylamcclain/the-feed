    <p style="color: antiquewhite;">here, i am currently in my copywriting class and i am working on completing a cover letter so i can start applying for internships. i was using platforms like canva, handshake, and indeed to scout for internship opportunities and create my very own customized cover letter. the internet was useful during this time as i was using it for social and professional reasons. </p>
