    <p style="color: antiquewhite;">I typically use the internet for inspiration, school, and to learn new things. I spend a lot of time on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest, mainly for social and creative purposes. On a more personal note, I sometimes use the internet to compare myself to other people around me, but then pause to remember that we are all unique and individual souls. I feel like the internet in the future of the internet is leaning toward a more comparative and competitive lifestyle as users continue to get wrapped up in these kinds of technologies. When I spent some time away from the internet recently, I took a few busses and walked around different parts of the city to find cool buttons at vintage shops and on the floor throughout my adventure. I discovered that it is much easier to find inspiration out in public rather through a screen. I have linked my findings at the bottom of the page - enjoy! I had a very fun time discovering these buttons and taking a breath without any screens present. On another note, while I do use the internet for research, learning new things, entertainment, maintaining a social life, as well as inspiration from other artists and creatives, I do find that the internet itself can be extremely addictive - even though it may feel as if it's helping us, it might be worsening our understanding of the world and how we interact with it.
