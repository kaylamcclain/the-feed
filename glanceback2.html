    <p style="color: antiquewhite;">this image was of me and my professor trying to figure out how ot get my glance back extension set up on my laptop - this was the first image i got on glance back, proving that the software would work. i used the internet during this time to connect an extension to my laptop temporarily and used a new technology to see what my laptop sees at random times. </p>
